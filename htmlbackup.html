    </h1> 
        
    <p class="dashed">Dissection, the action of breaking something down into its component parts in order to better understand it, appears repeatedly in human endeavors. It is an investigation driven, as most investigations are, either by curiosity or by an intense need for understanding. We break a thing down to find out what it is made of, how it works, and why the whole exists as it does. <br><br>

The objects gathered in this exhibit reveal attempts made by their creators to dissect subjects of great interest to them. These objects, which appear in the form of photographs, antiquarian books, and artist books, reside in special collections located in libraries across the world. Each object is evidential in nature, the result of intensive research or experimentation that in some way simulates the procedure of a dissection. <br><br>


Some dissections are carried out postmortem. They are attempts to understand the events of the past, like Sophie Calle’s post-relationship equivocation <i>Take Care of Yourself.</i> Postmortem dissections can also be attempts to understand phenomena that extend from the past to the present, like Michelle Dizon’s investigation of long-standing bias in Sociology in <i>White Gaze.</i> In their most recognizable (and literal) iteration, postmortem dissections are carried out with an eye toward the future, like Andreas Vesalius’s scientific, educational, and anatomical <i>De Humani.</i> There is a sense of sacrifice in this third kind, a solemn acceptance of one death that is closely tied to a vulnerable hope that such an endeavor may help prevent future deaths. <br><br>

Other dissections are non-invasive and can be carried out while the subject continues to thrive. These dissections often take the form of snapshots in time. Attempts to freeze and even break down time can be observed in Muybridge’s and Dickson’s photographs. As Dickson breaks down the small death that is a sneeze, he replaces its folkloric existential peril with fact and even humor. <br><br>


All dissections, thus, grapple with death. They are human attempts to understand, postpone, or invite finality. Crucially, they leave behind evidence, laid out in a way that will be explicitly understandable to future viewers. In this way, they serve as generous offerings for others to benefit in kind from their creators’ labored research. They are invitations for connection.

The term “small death” refers to a brief perceived loss of consciousness. During the aforementioned Renaissance period, it was believed that a sneeze temporarily stopped a person’s heart. Dickson inverts this sentiment by temporarily stopping a sneeze through photography, imbuing the action with both factuality and humor.</p>

De humani corporis fabrica libri septem</i> 1568<br>Andreas Vesalius<br>Book bound in human skin by Josse Schavye<br>Brown University's John Hay Library, History of Science Collection<br><br>De Humani Corporis Fabrica offers detailed drawings and descriptions of the human anatomy. On page 164, a skeleton stands cross-legged, eye sockets gazing down at a skull that rests beneath its right hand, presumably contemplating its own (post)mortal state. A memento mori of such heavy-handed self reflexivity proves presciently apropos for an anatomy book that would someday find itself bound in human skin. The source of the skin used in the binding of this book remains a mystery.<br><br>*Note: the 1st image is of a copy housed at the Smithsonian Libraries, also bound by Josse Schavye, and suspected to be bound in human skin. The second image shows Brown University's copy bound in human skin on the bottom of the stack; photographs of this copy are rare. Images of interior pages are from a copy housed in Universitätsbibliothek Basel in Switzerland.</p>
